More work on the tell-a-friend feature. Especially making sure the error/success messages
are shown up properly after. The URL might need better handling of the #i anchor link.

IssueTracker Manager and IssueTracker User should automatically have
the IssueTracker Access permission. Hmm... how does one do that?

Additional options at the bottom of Add Issue. These should be shown
below the submit&preview buttons. The additional options could very

 - Confidential option
 - Hide me option
 - Version number input
 - First status

These should all be disabled by default.
